                                                  Personal Project - (Study) 

The goal was to create an application using React (focusing on props/state/mapping/API) where the user can type in a stock ticker symbol an get the company quote in return from an external API (in this case I used AlphaVantage). For the UI prototyping I decided to go with Semantic UI, so I could easily create the containers and start working on the logic part. Follow bellow a simple gif showing the application:
